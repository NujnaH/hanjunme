		<h4>Brief Introduction</h4>
		<p>My name is Hanjun Kim, currently a fifth year student at the University of Waterloo. I am part of the Mechatronics Engineering and have had a great deal of work experience working for various companies throughout the co-op program offered by the university.<br><br>
I have primarily done programming in languages such as Java and C# throughout my work terms and have done projects in C/C++ before. I enjoy creating products that people will get to interact with. I truly believe that all products created for the user should be easy to use and aesthetically pleasing.<br><br>
I am an active individual and enjoy activities such as swimming, volleyball and rock climbing. I love to try new things in life, and wish to experience extreme activities like wingsuit flying when I get the chance.<br><br>
Other hobbies include reading, photography, and playing video games.<br><br>
Feel free to contact me via any of the methods listed below at any time.
