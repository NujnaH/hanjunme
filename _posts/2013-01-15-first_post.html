This is the second week of building my website, and I've decided that what I want is for my main page to become a blog website. So that's what this will become in the end. A banner at the top will have headlines, kind of like what <a href="http://www.theverge.com">The Verge</a> does with their website, and I'm thinking of using a commenting system powered by either disqus or livefyre. Let's see how this turns out
