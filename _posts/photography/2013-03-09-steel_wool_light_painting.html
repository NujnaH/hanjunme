After watching a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=LJkBLMhXvcQ&NR=1">YouTube video</a> almost a month ago, my friend <a href="http://shutterdebug.com">Anthony Chuang</a> and I decided to try light painting with steel wool. I've always been fascinated with light painting and this seemed like a simple affordable way to start. We brainstormed some ideas and were thinking of having a shot of a person holding an umbrella underneath the raining sparks, but due to weather conditions and such, decided to leave that for another day. Instead, we decided to try some photos at the Waterloo Park in the city of.. Waterloo.<br><br>
The tutorial has warned us that sparks were going to fly everywhere and it was a good thing we chose not to do these shots on campus at the University of Waterloo. To get a decent picture, the steel-wool-inside-a-wisk-tied-to-a-rope setup had to be spun really fast. As a consequence, sparks flew in every direction, popping and fizzing everywhere.</p>

After some trial and error to fix up the composition, exposure, and the spinning technique, we managed to take some great shots to show. The next time this is tried, more steel wool is required, as those things burn surprisingly fast. I want to try other locations next time, perhaps with a stone building as the setting, and also want to try more portrait like shots as well.<br><br>
