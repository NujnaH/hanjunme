Last week I decided on impulse that I wanted a new phone. Something that was cheap, but with great performance, and good build quality. Wind Mobile is now offering the HTC 8S, which I've been eyeing with interest for a while at $299, and LG's Nexus 4 was my other choice. There was a set budget of $300 because I could sell my current phone, Samsung Galaxy S3, for around that price at the moment. While the 8S is a phone with great design, I decided that Windows Phone is not something I want to use as my main OS for now.<br><br>
Hence the Nexus 4. It turned out to be a great choice so far. I've used this phone for half a day now and I am very impressed so far. It offers an experience identical to the Galaxy S3, it feels much better in hand. The glass front and back gives the phone a nice balanced weight, greater than that of the Galaxy S3. It feels like a premium device when pressing the volume rocker or the power button. The buttons depress with an amount of resistance that the buttons seem premium without making sacrificing usability. The 4.7" screen is pleasant to look at with its 1280x768 True HD IPS Plus screen. It's very bright, but when comparing the screen to an AMOLED screen, such as the one on the Galaxy S3, the colours are not as vibrant. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the AMOLED tends to oversaturate images.</p>

<br><p>The device is a great bang for the buck, having great specs and feel for merely $309. It does have some flaws however. The buttons do not have much room for depression. It's hard to feel that the buttons have been pressed for sure. It would be even more so when the buttons are pressed with gloves on, or in the pocket. In addition, the back glass has a glittery appearance in direct light. Arguably, this is personal preference on design, but I'm not a big fan of it. I've ordered a vinyl from dbrand (link below) to cover up the glittery back.</p>

<br><p>Overall, I feel that this is a great purchase because I break even when I sell my Galaxy S3 tomorrow, and it provides the premium feeling that I've greatly missed from my iPhone 4S days. Later this week, Canonical is releasing Ubuntu Phone OS for the Nexus 4. I'm really excited to try it out and maybe I can use it on a long term base. Even if I don't, I truly enjoy the Android experience, and would love it even more on such a nice device.<br><br>
