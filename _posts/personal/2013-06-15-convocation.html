Today was an important milestone in my life: the end to my undergraduate life. Looking back, September of 2008, when I first entered the University of Waterloo as a frosh seems like just yesterday. A lot has happened in the past five years and what a journey it was. I've learnt many lessons in life, met some great people who I will remember for the rest of my life and most of all, I've had fun. Granted, the journey wasn't the smoothest. It's hard its hardships and dull moments. But you can't have shining moments if you don't have bad times to make that moment shine brilliantly.<br><br>
In some ways, I feel the same as when I first entered university; full of energy, curious about many things in life and unsure of where to go. At the same time, I feel a lot more prepared for what lies ahead. I feel more matured, ready to take on life's challenges and able to think calmly about most problems. Real life here I come!
