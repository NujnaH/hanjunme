I wish I could say that we've worked on this project really hard for the last year since we first proposed the idea to the professors in September. Rather than working on it regularly, we've had two (semi) intensive hackathons spanning the entire weekend. What I got out of the experience was that while the end product can be very fun to enjoy, making a game is not something I ever want to do again. I truly enjoyed brainstorming, implementing gameplay and creating the visuals of the game, but all of this was offset by the pain of trying to learn the theory behind graphics. While graphics is not too challenging, it's hard to wrap your head around it at first, and implementing it is a tedious task. Regardless, I think that our team made an awesome game and below is the game in action at 3AM before the day of the presentation.</p>

<p>In other news, now that the design project is done, I now have some more time! That time has to be spent on other projects for now unfortunately. Truly fun but busy times. Also, I'm working on revamping the website because I want to improve it.<br><br>
