This website is currently under construction but I feel as if this website is almost ready to be published. There are a number of kinks which must be worked out of course before officially publishing however. The carousel on the front page must be updated so that the images are the correct height once again. Testing of the webpage for new categories must be done. The gallery page needs to be completed and the Livefyre plugin must have its layout updated so that the comments are not growing from the bottom up.<br><br>
I am quite happy with the way this website is looking at the moment. Twitter's Bootstrap has given me a powerful style sheet which looks modern and has made the web design process much easier. I hope that the momentum stays for the rest of the week and hopefully I can say the website is finished (minus the photos page) by the end of the week. At that point, I suspect I'll have a lot more school work to do, and I must start working on projects like the FYDP.<br><br>
