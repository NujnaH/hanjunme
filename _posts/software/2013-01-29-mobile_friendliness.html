After talking to my friends about my website and how it looks after the first release a couple of weeks ago, I decided that I should make some modifications to the website. The banner at the top of the front page is gone for now, the "Blog" link on the navigation bar at the top is gone, and the blogs are not a boring static list anymore. I'm still making changes to the website, but the progress is much slower since I actually have school work to do now, and I have to think carefully about my next steps in the design of the website. However, the website definitely needed to be updated to accomodate mobile devices. I was missing a line of code at the top of my webpages:</p>
<pre class="code">
&#60;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" &#47;&#62;
</pre>
<p>It turns out that this line of code helps to make my website display the screen resolution vs. the screen size (making mobile devices with insanely high resolutions display the website as a mobile site scaled up), making it much easier to read on mobile devices. With the help of my friends, <a href="http://mavericklee.com">Maverick Lee</a> and <a href="http://shutterdebug.com">Anthony Chuang</a>, I was able to figure out my problem with my website when viewed on mobile, and was able to re-define my website. Hopefully the website looks much better and has great readability now. I certainly think it does and I hope others do too.

Oh, and I hope I will post more often.. I still need to get more traffic and get to the front page of Google!<br><br>
