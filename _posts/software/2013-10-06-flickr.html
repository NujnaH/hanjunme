After many months of not doing anything with the website, I have finally decided to touch the website. Because I don't want to blog much, I've decided to make this website a photography centric website. I will create posts regarding photography, my experiences trying to photograph various locations or occassions and post (hopefully) quality photos onto the website. In light of that, I've decided that I should link my website's photos to my Flickr feed. This way, I'll be able to focus the web traffic down to one place (because I like looking at analytics and it showing great numbers), and also it will speed up the load times of the images because my website is hosted on a cheap server which also happens to be pretty slow.<br><br>
The implementation was pretty fast. I was able to get the code to do an AJAX call to my photos set and pull them to the website in approximately half an hour all inclusive. Below is the link to the website I've looked at as a guide to get this to work.
