		        <h2>A late start is better than a no start (FYDP)</h2>
		        <p>February 04, 2013<br>It's already February, a month into my last study term here at the University of Waterloo. The Mechatronics Engineering students here at the University of Waterloo are supposed to form a group and design something, which encompasses what we learned in our undergrad career. The topic is left up to the students to decide, so that they can form teams with similar interests and create what they want. I have a formed a group with three classmates, all of whom have a very strong software backgrond from co-op terms. Hence, we decided that we would do a software based design project, but alas, the mentor professor told us that as Mechatronics students, we must incorporate the use of sensors into our project. As a result, we've decided to create a game which processes audio files, namely music files, in order to generatea game level, and which can be played by the user using a Microsoft Kinect.<br><br>
This was all decided last term, when we were supposed to be laying out what the project would look like, how it would function, and proposing the ideas to the class. It is expected that most groups start working on their design projects almost immediately after getting back from the Christmas holidays. A month into the term, I've finally made a little bit of progress in the design project. The Github repository, which has been sitting, empty for over a month, finally has some meaningful files check in. After getting my feet wet and seeing for myself how to build simple windows with graphics in it, I am beginning to grasp what a daunting task I have ahead of me. This project is due in about a month's time, and everything must be built, refined and be presentable by then. At least the project has begun to take shape now, rather than a week or two later. To mark this great milestone in our FYDP, here are some design choices made so far.<br><br></p>
<h3>Technologies Being Used</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Operating System:</b> Windows</li>
<li><b>IDE Software:</b> Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate</li>
<li><b>Graphics Library:</b> Simple DirectMedia Layer</li>
<li><b>Programming Language:</b> C++</li>
</ul>
<p>While three of the four group members own a Mac, we decided to use Windows, since the Kinect can only interface with a Windows PC, or a Xbox. The group has agreed to use C++ as the primary language for the project, as everyone in the group has at least some exposure to C++, and there is great community support around C++ in general, and for game development in the language as well. Visual Studio was chosen as the IDE because students get free licenses for the software through MSDN. The reason I have chosen to use 2010 edition, rather than the 2012 edition is that the debuggers and the DLL (dynamic link library) are different. This became a problem when investigating which graphics library/game engine to use, as a lot of the engines provides DLLs and prebuilt projects for the 2010 edition, but not the 2012.<br><br></p>
<h3>Simple DirectMedia Layer</h3>
<p>After investigating numerous options for graphics, I have decided on using SDL for building the graphics of our game. There were a number of reasons for this choice. The first reason was the ease of set-up. SDL libraries were quite easy to link to a project and use. There are a few build paths which must be configured and afterwards, the source code just has to include the necessary header files. The second reason is that it is a simple layer over OpenGL from my current understanding. OpenGL is great for making surfaces for graphics, but it is unable to create windows, amongst some other limitations. SDL extends the functionality of OpenGL and provides additional capability, such as the ability to create windows. I am unclear at this point about the full capabilities and functionalities of SDL. Some game engines provide the ability to handle audio output in the game, handle input from various sources, etc. SDL can definitely handle graphics, but further research must be done to check whether SDL can handle everything we need, or whether we require additional libraries and engines.<br><br>
