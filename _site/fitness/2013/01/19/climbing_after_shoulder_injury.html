		        <h2>Climbing after Shoulder Injury</h2>
		        <p>January 19, 2013<br>Summer of 2010, a friend and I decided to try out rock climbing on a Friday night, decided we liked the experience and decided to keep going. Despite the numerous breaks we had to have due to schedules that don't line up, me being away from town for school, exchange program, etc. we've come a long way, steadily making progress, until last summer. Last August, I went to a water park and decided to climb an outdoor climbing wall that they had. For some unexplained reason, as I was hanging with my left arm, which I have done many times before, my arm pulled out of my shoulder socket. I didn't think too much of it and went rock climbing with a bunch of friends in September, dislocating the shoulder once again. At this point I decided that I should probably go see a doctor about it and have been taking a break from climbing ever since.<br><br>
Fast forward to now, I have gone through many physiotherapy sessions and have been slowly and carefully strengthening my shoulder again. I wanted to save my first climb since the break until I was in Toronto and go with my usual partner, but decided that it would be good to give climbing a shot right now, while I was close to my physiotherapist and what not before going to climb with him.<br><br>
I decided that this time, I'll take it even easier than I did in September, sticking to 5.8's and 5.9's, rather than tackling 5.10- routes like I did back in September. It turned out to be a wise choice. Doing some basic moves such as hanging off of the wall with my left arm extended, or trying to pull myself up with my left arm at certain angles made me cringe and stop climbing those routes any longer. I'm not sure if it's a psychological trauma factor from previous injuries or the shoulder was actually being pulled out most of the time, but it certainly was on the verge of popping back out at one point.<br><br>
This experience made me realize that I need to train my shoulder a lot more to be back at the level of climbing I was at before. It's depressing knowing that I've made such a regression from just one injury but I just have to work through it. Hopefully training more will let me be able to perform all the moves I could before, and prevent any further instances of my injury, as it'll result in a surgery next time or the time after.<br><br>
