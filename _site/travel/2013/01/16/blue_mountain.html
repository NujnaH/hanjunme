		        <h2>Blue Mountain</h2>
		        <p>January 16, 2013<br>I suppose this will be my first post in the travel section. Over the past weekend I went to Blue Mountain on a ski/snowboard trip with my friends. We spent three days there in total and had a pretty fun time. Basically we drank lots of ciders like Fruli, Somersby, Strongbow, as well as some soju and tequila. We arrived at Blue Mountain fifteen minutes before closing and successfully got our double down passes, which was pretty lucky of us because the line to get the double down is really long during the day. Then we just spent the night drinking a good portion of the alcohol we brought along and playing with some fancy Super Mario cards.<br><br>
We woke up on the second day and hit the slopes. The temperature over the weekend was around 7&#186; so I was worried that the conditions would be really bad. Although some of the hills had grass and mud exposed, overall the slopes were in a decent condition. I suspected that going snowboarding after a two year hiatus would be very disastrous and I was quite worried when I fell trying to do the first turn on the bunny hill. However, I quickly ramped back up to speed and was able to tackle a double black diamond and couple of black diamonds. I was pretty amazed because I've only ever gone on green and blue hills before.</p>

<br><p>After being on the slopes for a good part of the day, it was time to go back to the resort (..lodging? Not really sure what to call it) and make dinner! We feasted on chicken alfredo fettuccine, salad with soy sauce and sriracha sauce, steak, smoked salmon and corn. What an amazing meal that was.<br><br>
After dinner a small group hit the slopes again for night skiing, quickly went back to join the others at the swimming pool/jacuzzi/sauna and then went back to our resort to drink once again. Everyone got drunk pretty fast because we were all exhausted after an intense day on the hills and people started going off to sleep early. A number of us went out on a drunken stroll around the resort grounds however, and had quite an adventure running around, losing keycards and such.<br><br>
Unfortunately it rained Saturday night so skiing on Sunday was a no-go. We headed back early sadly. It was a slightly disappointing end to an amazing weekend but we were all tired anyways so I guess it was for the better. Since cottage trips in the summer, I haven't had any fun homey weekends out with friends. It was good to have such a weekend once again and I really look forward to our next adventure. :D
